# Mini-Project: Encryption-Decryption Machine
You will have to create two Python scripts - one for encrypting, and another one for decrypting. It is up to you what prime numbers to use as **p** and **q**, but the larger, the better.

## Encryption process:

Take a string as user input (you can use Pythonâ€™s input() function for that)
Then print the cipher

## Decryption process:

Take the cipher as user input.
Print the original message. Since the cipher is a list of integers, the description script must have some way of reading the cipher one element at a time (e.g. by separating the numbers with commas 33,66,77,88).

### Run
#### Encryption
`python encryption.py`
#### Decryption
`python decryption.py`
